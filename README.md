# 📊 Data Visualization & Financial Analysis in Excel

**Applying Tufte’s Principles to Real-World Data**

## 🔍 Project Overview

This project focused on transforming raw numerical data into clear, meaningful visualizations using Microsoft Excel. The goal was not just to make charts, but to apply **Edward Tufte’s data visualization principles** — emphasizing clarity, minimizing clutter, and maximizing data storytelling.

Across multiple worksheets, I analyzed **consumer purchase behavior, demographic comparisons, personal financial cashflow, and stock market performance** using a wide variety of Excel chart types.

## 📈 Key Project Sections & What I Learned

### 🥇 Consumer Purchases by Sport (Pie of Pie + Sparklines)

**What I did:**
Created a Pie of Pie chart to highlight which sports categories drive the most consumer purchases, and used sparklines to show sales trends over time.

**Skills Learned**

* Using filters to dynamically change chart data
* Using images inside chart elements (filled Exercise slice with a dumbbell image)
* Creating time-series sparklines in a compact space

**Insights**

* Exercise equipment consistently represented the largest share of purchases
* Sparklines made it easy to spot trends without taking up dashboard space

### 👟 Footwear Purchases vs US Population

(Clustered, Stacked, and 100% Stacked Column Charts)

**What I did:**
Compared footwear purchases by age group against US population percentages.

**Skills Learned**

* Comparing distribution vs totals using different chart types
* Editing series names dynamically using cell references
* Formatting axes as percentages

**Best Chart:**
The **Clustered Column Chart** told the clearest story because it directly compared **purchase share vs population share** side-by-side.

**Key Insight**

* Certain age groups purchased footwear at rates **disproportionately higher** than their share of the population — indicating stronger market segments.

---

### 🏕 Camping Purchases (Area Charts)

**What I did:**
Used standard, stacked, and 100% stacked area charts to compare camping purchases by age.

**Skills Learned**

* When area charts become misleading due to stacking
* Using chart filters to remove less relevant groups (65+)

**Best Chart:**
The **standard area chart** was the most readable.
The stacked versions hid individual contributions and made comparisons harder.

**Key Insight**

* Middle age groups showed the strongest participation in camping purchases.

### 💵 Personal Monthly Cashflow (Waterfall Chart)

**What I did:**
Built a waterfall chart to track income and expenses across a month.

**Skills Learned**

* Financial flow visualization
* Identifying negative cashflow periods
* Custom coloring for increases, decreases, and totals

**Insights**

* A large expense before the second paycheck caused a temporary negative balance
* Visualizing timing of expenses is just as important as totals
* Surplus money should ideally go to **savings or emergency funds**

---

### 📉 S&P 500 OHLC Stock Chart

**What I did:**
Created a professional stock chart showing daily price movements.

**Skills Learned**

* Financial chart formatting
* Axis scaling to highlight subtle price changes
* Red/green candlestick styling for price direction

**Insights**

* Market fluctuations are easier to interpret when unnecessary whitespace is removed
* Tight axis scaling improves analytical value

---

### 🍏 Apple VOHLC Chart (Price + Volume)

**What I did:**
Built a combined price and trading volume chart.

**Skills Learned**

* Dual-axis financial charts
* Separating volume from price visually
* Formatting large numeric scales

**Insights**

* Volume spikes often aligned with major price movements
* Seeing volume alongside price gives better context for volatility

---

### 📊 Stock Performance Comparison (Combo Chart + Trendlines)

**What I did:**
Compared Apple vs S&P 500 performance using a dual-axis combo line chart with trendlines.

**Skills Learned**

* Charting across multiple worksheets without duplicating data
* Using secondary axes correctly
* Trendline slope comparison

**Insights**

* Apple showed **greater volatility** but stronger upward movements
* The S&P 500 showed **steadier, more consistent growth**
* Trendlines made long-term performance differences immediately visible

## 🧠 Overall Takeaways

This project strengthened my ability to:

✔ Choose the **right chart type** for the story
✔ Avoid misleading visuals
✔ Use Excel as a **business intelligence tool**
✔ Present financial and demographic data clearly
✔ Apply professional visualization standards

I also learned that **good data visualization is about decisions, not decoration**. The goal is clarity, not complexity.

## 🚀 Final Thought

This assignment mirrored real analyst work — turning raw data into insights that guide decisions. The combination of **consumer analytics, financial planning, and stock analysis** provided hands-on experience with the types of visualizations used in business, finance, and consulting roles.
